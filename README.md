# Time-Series-Forecasting
### AR(p) (Auto Regression)
- The time series is linearly regressed on its own past value
- p is the number of past values included in the AR model

### MA(q) (Moving Average) 
- The time series is regressed on the past forecast errors
- q is the number of past forecast errors included in the MA model

### ARMA(p, q) (Auto Regression Moving Average)

### ARIMA(p, d, q) (Auto Regression Integrated Moving Average)
- d is the number of times the time series is differenced
- General process for ARIMA models:
  - Visualize the Time Series Data
  - Make the time series data stationary by differencing
  - Plot the Correlation and AutoCorrelation Charts
  - Construct the ARIMA Model or Seasonal ARIMA based on the data
  - Use the model to make predictions
